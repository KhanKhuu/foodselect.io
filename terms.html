							<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="policy-details">
							<p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will 
							automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore 
							that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not 
							allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or 
							our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to 
							extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t 
							try to translate the app into other languages, or make 
							derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, 
							copyright, database rights and other intellectual property 
							rights related to it, still belong to Matthew Larkins.</p>
							
							<p>Matthew Larkins is committed to ensuring that the app is as 
							useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve 
							the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its 
							services, at any time and for any reason. We will never 
							charge you for the app or its services without making it very 
							clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
							
							<p>It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the 
							app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or 
							root your  phone, which is the process of removing software 
							restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating 
							system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to 
							malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s 
							security features, and it could mean that the FoodSelect app 
							won’t work properly or at all.</p>
							
							<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Matthew 
							Larkins will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of 
							the app will require the app to have an active internet 
							connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your 
							mobile network provider, but Matthew Larkins cannot take 
							responsibility for the app not working at full functionality 
							if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of 
							your data allowance left.</p>
							
							<p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you 
							should remember that your terms of the agreement with your 
							mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may 
							be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for 
							the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or 
							other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting 
							responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data 
							charges if you use the app outside of your home territory 
							(i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If 
							you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re 
							using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have 
							received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
							
							<p>Along the same lines, Matthew Larkins cannot always take 
							responsibility for the way you use the app, e.g. You need to 
							make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of 
							battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Matthew 
							Larkins cannot accept responsibility.</p>
							
							<p>With respect to Matthew Larkins’s responsibility for your use 
							of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear 
							in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is 
							updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties 
							to provide information to us so that we can make it available 
							to you. Matthew Larkins accepts no liability for any loss, 
							direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying 
							wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
							
							<p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is 
							currently available on iOS – the requirements for the system 
							(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the 
							availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to 
							download the updates if you want to keep using the app. 
							Matthew Larkins does not promise to always update the app
							so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS
							version that you have installed on your device. However, 
							you promise to always accept updates to the application when 
							offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, 
							and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice 
							of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any 
							termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in 
							these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if 
							needed) delete it from your device.</p>
